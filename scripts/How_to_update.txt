Scripts to assist us in various tasks


Scripts are there to take care of all repetitive tasks to create an iso like

	- getting latest info from Archlabs-Openbox-Config and putting it in skel
	- getting latest info from Archlabs-Conky-New-Syntax and putting it in skel
	- getting latest info from Archlabs-Tint2 and putting it in skel
	- creating an iso 



Personal setup 


Make a directory with the name ARCHLABS on your home directory.

All githubs from ARCHLABS go inside this folder including the Archlabs-Iso.

We will gradually make more scripts to update parts of the iso with these scripts.

The scripts assume they are all in the same directory and will get all updated information.

You should update all githubs before building the iso (git-vx.sh)
