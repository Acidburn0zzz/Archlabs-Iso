Updating various parts from the iso coming from different githubs

Make a directory with the name ARCHLABS on your home directory.

All githubs from ARCHLABS go inside this folder including the Archlabs-Iso.

We will gradually make more scripts to update parts of the iso with these scripts.

In essence it is a repetitive task. 

People update the seperate githubs. The githubs need to be included lateron. It can become a monthly release or so.

In order to facilitate the iso build we run scripts to get the most recent files from github and put them in the right place on the Archlabs-Iso.

Nothing more nothing less.

Read the code first and run then.
